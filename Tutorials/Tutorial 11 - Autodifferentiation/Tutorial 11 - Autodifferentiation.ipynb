    "# Autodifferentiation tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will be implementing autodifferentiation from scratch, without using external python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will be defining a custom `Value` object in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This object defines a scalar value (analogous to a python `float`) which can have primitive operations (e.g. add/multiply/pow) applied to it. Each primitive operation returns a new `Value` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly, each `Value` object keeps track of the child `Value` objects which created it, and defines a `._backward` method which computes the vector-Jacobian product of the primative operation which created it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This extra bookmarking allows us to define a `Value.backward()` method (similar to `PyTorch`) which recursively backpropagates gradients through the entire computational graph, accumulating gradients in the leaf `Values` of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part A: implement the `Value` class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Value` class is defined in `engine.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of lines of code missing from this class that you must fill in:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Task A.1**: Implement the primitive operations which currently raise a `NotImplementedError`\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Task A.2**: Implement the `Value.backward` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Task A.3**: Test that the class is correctly implemented by running the tests defined in `engine.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "More hints are contained in `engine.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part B: use the `Value` class to solve a differentiable physics problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have a working `Value` object, we can use it to solve any problem requiring gradients.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part, we will use the `Value` object to learn how to **throw a ball** to hit a target.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are located at $P1 = (0,0)$ and you throw a ball with an initial velocity $v$ at an angle $\\alpha$ from the x-axis. Your goal is to hit a target at $P2 = (x_2, y_2)$. What are values of $\\alpha$ and $v$ you should use?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can treat this as a inverse problem, where the goal is to minimise the following loss function\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "L(v,\\alpha) = (F(v, \\alpha, x_2) - y_2)^2 ~~~~~~~(1)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $F(v, \\alpha, x_2)$ is our forward physics model, which tells us the height of the ball at $x_2$ given the initial velocity and angle of the ball.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $F$ is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "F(v, \\alpha, x_2) = - \\frac{g}{2} \\left( \\frac{x_2}{v \\cos \\alpha} \\right)^2 + x_2 \\tan \\alpha ~~~~~~~(2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Optional task B.1**: Derive (2) using Netwon's laws.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Task B.2**: Write a python function that computes $F(v, \\alpha, x_2)$, where $v$ and $\\alpha$ are `Value` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Task B.3**: Use `Value.backward` to write a gradient descent algorithm which minimises the loss function (1), given the starting guess of $v$ and $\\alpha$ below.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Task B.4**: Verify that the learned values of $\\alpha$ and $v$ hits the target by plotting the optimised trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Task B.5**: What happens to the trajectory when you change the starting guess of $v$ and $\\alpha$? Why is this the case?"
